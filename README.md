# Advent of Code 2023

## AoC GO 2023

I wanted to challenge myself to learn a new language, and I've been interested in Go for a while, so I decided to use Advent of Code 2023 as an opportunity to learn it.
On top of that, I've been wanting to get more comfortable in vim/neovim, so I'm using this as an opportunity to learn that as well. I will partially use neovim and partially use GoLand if I get frustrated with vim ðŸ¥´.

I have never written a single line of Go before, and I have a full time job along with a 4-month-old at this point in time, so I'm not sure how far I'll get, but I'm going to try my best!
